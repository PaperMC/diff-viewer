# Patch Roulette Web Extension

## Building

1. Install the latest version of [`bun`](https://bun.sh/) (1.2.8 at time of writing)
2. Run `bun install` to install dependencies
3. Run `bun run build` to build the extension

The built extension will be in the `dist` directory. It can be directly loaded into
Chrome or Firefox as an unpacked extension for testing, or zipped for submission to
the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons site.
